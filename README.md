# Robotic Arm – 3D Design using Tinkercad

## What this project does
This repository contains a **3D-designed robotic arm**, created entirely in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
The design demonstrates basic mechanical principles of robotics and can be used for:
- Learning how robotic arms are structured.
- Visualizing joint movement and link dimensions.
- Serving as a prototype for automation or pick-and-place tasks.

## Why this project is useful
- **Beginner-friendly** – No advanced CAD software required.  
- **Fully customizable** – Dimensions, joint types, and gripper design can be easily modified.  
- **Educational** – Great for teaching robotics, kinematics, or basic mechanical design.  
- **3D-printable** – Can be fabricated as a physical model with standard 3D printers.

## Getting started
### View the design
1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
2. Import the provided `.stl` or `.obj` files.  

### Modify the design
- Use Tinkercad's editor to adjust link lengths, add mounting holes, or redesign the gripper.
- Export as `.stl` to 3D print your customized version.
